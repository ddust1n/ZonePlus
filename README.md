## ZonePlus v3
ZonePlus utilises the [Spatial Query API](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/introducing-overlapparams-new-spatial-query-api/1435720) and Whitelists to effectively determine players, parts and custom items within a zone. You can have as many zones as you like, as large as you like, with zero-to-minimal additional cost to performance.

###### Disclaimer: ZonePlus, at least v3- is not being actively maintained. This is a fork for fixes and personal features.
